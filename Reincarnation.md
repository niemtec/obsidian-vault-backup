## In Hinduism

- Strong belief in reincarnation where the destiny of the soul continues in a series of transmigrations.
- A dead person inhibits a new body.

> "The aim is that through each lifetime, the soul will improve itself until it achieved perfection"

- The nature of the new body is determined by the law of Karma.
- Reincarnation supports the idea of a disembodied self, that survival after death is possible without the body.
