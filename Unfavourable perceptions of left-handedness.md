### Cultural prejudice against [[left-handedness]]
- In the past children who were naturally left-handed were encouraged (or forced) to use their right hand mainly due to the prejudice against the awkwardness of left-handed writing and prevalence of "right-handed" utensils.

> As a child, British king George VI (1895–1952) was naturally left-handed. He was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time.

- Apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority.
- Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.
- In the Soviet Union, all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system.

#### Industrial Revolution
- When Industrial Revolution spread across Western Europe and the United States in the 19th century, workers needed to operate complex machines that were designed with right-handers in mind. 
	- This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy.
- At this time children were taught to use a dip pen which was challenging for lefties as they couldn't easily push the pen without digging into the paper and making blots and stains.
