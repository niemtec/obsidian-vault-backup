- Software development is immune from almost all physical laws, apart from **entropy** This is known as software rot.
- Many factors contribute to software rot, primarily psychology, or culture, at work on a project.
- Studies show that hopelessness can be contagious, this supports the idea of the [[Broken Window Theory in Software Development]] and provides reasoning as to why it spreads through the contagion medium of hopelessness.
- You should never leave “broken windows” (bad designs, decisions, poor code etc) un-repaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered ([[The Boyscout Rule]]) and if there is insufficient time to fix it properly then at least “board it up”.

> In high-pressure situations, don’t cause collateral damage just because there is a crisis of some sort. One broken window is one too many already.

- If you find yourself on a project where the code is well groomed, you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up. Even if there’s a deadline, release date or a demo, **you** don’t want to be the first one to make a mess and inflict additional damage.
