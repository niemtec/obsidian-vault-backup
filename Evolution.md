Evolution is a behaviour that emerges in any system that has:

1. [[mutation]]
2. [[heredity]]
3. [[selection]]

Evolutionary systems often generate unexpected solutions. Nature selects for good enough.

If you really understand the theory of evolution, you accept that there is no [[Soul]]. Evolution cannot accept the idea of [[Soul]]s, at least if by "[[Soul]]" you mean something indivisible, [[immutable]] and potentially eternal -- such an entity _cannot_ be the result of step-by-step evolution. _Evolution means change_, and it is incapable of producing everlasting entities.

Evolving systems exist in [[Punctuated Equilibrium]].
