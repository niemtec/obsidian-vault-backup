- People with ADHD have, in general, a higher eagerness for sex according to Ari Tuckman who interviewed 3000 participants where people with ADHD scored higher on 10 out of 12 items regarding questions about frequencies, kinkiness and interests in non-monogamy
  - This leads to troubles in relationships between people with and without ADHD as it asks for a lot of negotiation
- According to Sari Cooper (in Journal of Sexual Medicine), ADHD individuals also experience less sexual satisfaction and more sexual dysfunctions than the general population
  - Some studies revealed that people with ADHD are less sexually satisfied in partnered sexual experiences (in part due to their wandering minds)
  - Being involved in a sexual script that is unvaried might lead to boredom and distraction from thoughts
- Since ADHD is tightly coupled with mood changes, this means that feelings of disinterest and boredom are part of it and influence the pursuit of dopamine within sexual activity
  - As people with ADHD can be very focused and all-in on a subject, yet move on for the matter of pursuit of new stimuli, this can easily translate to continuous sexual pursuits
