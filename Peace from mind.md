When I say you want to be happy, what Iâ€™m actually saying is you want to find peace. We say peace of [[Mind]], but what we really want is [peace from [[Mind]]](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1005107581289824256?lang=en).

The [[Mind]] goes quiet during the moments of greatest pleasure. We seek the moment of peace from the voice inside our head.

At some point the [[Mind]] became an uncontrollable master rather than a servant.

Our [[Mind]] evolved to be paranoid, fearful and angry.
