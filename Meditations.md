“Meditations” is the title given to a journal and private thoughts of [[Marcus Aurelius]], he was trained in [[Stoicism]] and practiced a series of spiritual exercises (exercises designed to humble him, making him more patient, empathetic, generous, and stronger in the face of adversity) almost every night.

Meditations had no official title at first since it was written by Marcus for himself and no one else, in fact it was originally referred to as “Ta eis heauton” meaning “To Himself”.

The book itself consists of various sayings, a few sentences or at most a paragraph. It has no inherent organisational structure however it does show patters emerging throughout.
