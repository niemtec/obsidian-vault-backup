-  The fundamentals of any given monoculture tend to surround what we should be living for — nation, religion, self, etc.
- There are a number of ways in which our current system has us shooting ourselves in the foot as we try to step forward:
  1.  **You believe that creating your best life is a matter of deciding what you want and going after it.**
      - In reality, you are psychologically incapable of being able to predict what will make you happy.
      - Your brain can only perceive what it has known so when you choose what you want for the future you are actually recreating a solution or an ideal of the past.
      - When things don't work out you think you've failed only because you didn't recreate something you perceived as desirable.
        - In reality, you likely created something better, but foreign, and your brain misinterpreted it as "bad" because of that.
  2.  **The only thing you are rushing toward is death.**
      - Accomplishing goals is not success. How much you expand the process is.
  3.  **When you consider doing something that you truly love and are invested in, you are going to feel an influx of fear and pain, mostly because it will involve being vulnerable.**
      - Bad feelings should not always be interpreted as deterrents. They are indicators that you are doing something frightening and worthwhile.
      - Not wanting to do something would make you feel indifferent about it. Fear = interest.
  4.  **The pattern of unnecessarily creating cruses in your life is actually an avoidance technique.**
      - It distracts you from actually having to be vulnerable or held accountable for whatever it is you're afraid of.
      - You're never upset for the reason you think you are: at the core of your desire to create a problem is simply the fear of being who you are and living the life you want.
  5.  **A belief is what you know to be true because experience has made it evident to you.**
      - If you want to change your life, change your beliefs.
      - If you want to change your beliefs, go out and have experiences that make them real to you. Not the opposite way around.
  6.  **Simply running into a "problem" forces you to take action to resolve it.**
      - "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way" — [[Marcus Aurelius]]
      - The action will inevitably lead you to think differently, behave differently, and choose differently.
  7.  **You think your past defines you, and worse, you think that it is an unchangeable reality.**
      - Your perception of the past changes as you do because experience is always multi-dimensional, there are a variety of memories, experiences, feelings, "gists" you can choose to recall... and what you choose is indicative of your present state of mind.
      - People get caught up in allowing the past to define them or haunt them simply because they have not evolved to the place of seeing how the past did not prevent them from achieving the life they want — it facilitated it.
      - You don't disregard painful or traumatic events, but simply to be able to recall them with acceptance and to be able to place them in the storyline of your personal evolution.
  8.  **You try to change other people, situations, and things (or complain about them) when anger = self-recognition.**
      - Most negative emotional reactions are you identifying a dissociated aspect of yourself.
      - Your "shadow selves" are the parts of you that at some point you were conditioned to believe were "not okay" so you suppress them and have done everything in your power to not acknowledge them.
      - The things you love about others are the things you love about yourself. The things you hate about others are the things you cannot see in yourself.
