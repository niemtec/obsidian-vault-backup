- The father has sex with his wife to conceive the son.
- The son is born, father is not getting any sexual attention as mother is breastfeeding son.
- Baby develops into a child, no longer needs her breasts so father gets attention.
- Child grows to adolescence, shifting the libido to the sexual organ.
- The father uses his sexual organ with the mother, so there is already a rival in the form of the father. This shift creates a tension between the father and the son.
- The [[Id]] has feelings of jealousy and hatred, and ultimately wants the father dead.
- The [[Super-Ego]] is concerned about respect for the father.
- The [[Ego]]'s defence mode kicks in, pushing the conflict into our unconscious mind (repression).
