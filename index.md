Welcome to "Bluebook", an experiment in curating a digital garden built from various notes stored in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault.

This is a collection of very raw notes on a wide variety of topics curated spontaneously, you might find tidbits on anything from philosophy, through linguistics, to programming and software development. The key thing to keep in mind is that these are intended as working notes so information within might be incomplete or unbalances â€” take it with a pinch of salt.

The rendered page is compiled using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) through a GitHub Workflow. Since the content of this page is pulled from a git submodule (a backup repository) the content might not be updated live and some formatting glitches can occur. This is an experiment and a work in progress.
