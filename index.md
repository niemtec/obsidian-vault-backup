Welcome to "Bluebook", an experiment in curating a digital garden built from various notes stored in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault.

This is a collection of very raw notes on a wide variety of topics curated spontaneously, you might find tidbits on anything from philosophy, through linguistics, to programming and software development. The key thing to keep in mind is that these are intended as working notes so information within might be incomplete or unbalances ‚Äî take it with a pinch of salt.

### üß≠ Navigating Bluebook
Bluebook is built upon the digital [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) methodology which means that the notes exist as individual elements connected together through hyperlinks forming a network. 

This network can be explored using the graph view visible on every page ‚Äî if the graph looks empty it means that there are no links leading to or from the page you are viewing. (In that case, you might want to try the search feature).

You can also navigate between notes using the backlinks section or by exploring the tags (usually listed at the top of every page).

### üè∑Ô∏è Starting categories
Here are some tags that you might find interesting to start exploring the content:
- #philosophy 
- #psychology 
- #software-engineering 
- #biology 
- #quote
- #mythology 
- #linguistics 

### üöß How does it work?
The rendered page is compiled using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) through a GitHub Workflow. Since the content of this page is pulled from a git submodule (a backup repository) the content might not be updated live and some formatting glitches can occur. This is an experiment and a work in progress.
