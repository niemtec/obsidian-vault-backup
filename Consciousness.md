Consciousness is believed to be the result of the complex electrochemical interactions in the [[Brain]]. Our mental experiences, such as [[Emotions]], fulfil some essential data-processing functions.

Y. N. Harari argued that consciousness is the biologically useless by-product of certain [[Brain]] processes. Similarly, consciousness may be a kind of mental pollution produced by the firing of complex [[Neural Networks]]. It doesnâ€™t do anything. It is just there.
