- People with ADHD feel an abiding need to create something. This unnamed appetite is omnipresent and with us all the time.
- Regardless of whether we understand what it is or not; the act of creation offers the magnet's north pole to our south and clicks us together.
- Creating things captivates us, plants us in the present, and sets us transfixed within the creative act, whatever it might happen to be.
- This “itch” can lead to major achievements and creations, or it can lead to addictions of all kinds as well as a host of other dangerous behaviours. Often it leads to both.
- If that itch goes unscratched, we tend to feel listless or depressed, unmotivated and at sea. If we pour our energies into something that is beneath our creative abilities, we tend to lose interest. [[Boredom is the kryptonite of ADHD brains]].
