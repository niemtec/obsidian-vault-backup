- [[Immanuel Kant]] believed that human experience could be divided between two realms, the realm of ideas and the realm of experience and that [[morality]] came from the realm of ideas. He thought that God, angels and human beings shared in the realm of ideas or the [[Noumenal]] world which was there to be discovered by our reason.
- The way we look at [[morality]] is structured by the human mind, which is able to understand some things a priori, before any use of our five senses, using practical reason.
- The second realm is the realm of the observable and of experience, which Kant calls the phenomenal realm. This part of the human experience can be felt, touched, seen, smelt, and heard. It includes our emotions, too, which [[Immanuel Kant]] continually contrasts with our reason.
- Humans access both realms: the [[Noumenal]] and the phenomenal. But [[morality]] takes its absolute authority from the [[Noumenal]] world and is derived [[A Priori]]. It is then proved to be true or false by being applied to the world of experience the synthetic.
- The phenomenal world is subject to order and patterns on what we observe [[A Posteriori]].
- The [[Noumenal]] world is subject to practical reason imposing order and patterns on what we deduce by a priori [[abstraction]]. (removing emotions or desires from the process)
