- The ability of an object to hide parts of its state and behaviours from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program
- To encapsulate something means to make it `private` and only accessible from within methods of its own class.
  - You can isolate the parts of the program that vary in independent modules, protecting the rest of the code from adverse effects
- The goal of encapsulation is to minimise the effect caused by changes
- [[Interfaces]] and [[Abstract Classes]]/[[Abstract Methods]] are based on the concepts of abstraction and encapsulation.
