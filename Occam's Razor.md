Ockham's Razor (or Occam's razor) is a principle that in explaining a thing no more assumptions should be made than are necessary. The principle is often invoked to defend reductionism or nominalism.

In human language: Don't overcomplicate things, just because an apple falls down from a tree doesn't mean that there are fairies that are cutting it down.
