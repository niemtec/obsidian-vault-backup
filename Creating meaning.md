- Meaning is created when many people weave together a common network of stories. Why does a particular action – such as getting married in a church, fasting on Ramadan or voting on election day – seem meaningful to me? Because my parents also think it is meaningful, as do my brothers, my neighbours, people in nearby cities and even the residents of far-off countries.
