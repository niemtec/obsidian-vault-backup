- A short time-boxed period is when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
- Many associate scrum sprints with agile, but they are not the same thing. **Scrum is a framework, agile is a set of principles**.
- Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of delivering working software frequently and responding to change quickly (over following a plan).
- Choosing the right work items for a sprint is a collaborative effort between the product owner, scrum master, and the development team.
	- The Product Owner discusses the objective that Sprint should achieve and the [[Product Backlog]] items that will help to achieve the Sprint goal.
## Sprint Lifecycle
1. [[Sprint Planning]]
2. [[Daily Scrum]]
3. [[Sprint Review]]
4. [[Sprint Retrospective]]

> [!success]+ Do's
> - Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured. This is the key to keeping everyone aligned and moving forward toward a common destination.
> - Do ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order.
> - Ensure you have a good understanding of [[Sprint Velocity]], and that it reflects things like leave and team meetings.
> - Do use the sprint planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.
> - Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done, like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off.

> [!failure]+ Don'ts
> - Don’t pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can’t be completed in the sprint.
> - Don’t forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature work, like bugs and engineering health.
> - Don’t let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint. Nail it down, and don’t focus so much on moving _fast_ that you forget to make sure everyone’s moving in _the same direction_.
> - Don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.
