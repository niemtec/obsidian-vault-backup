- A short time-boxed period is when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
- Many associate scrum sprints with agile, but they are not the same thing. **Scrum is a framework, agile is a set of principles**.
- Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of delivering working software frequently and responding to change quickly (over following a plan).
- Choosing the right work items for a sprint is a collaborative effort between the product owner, scrum master, and the development team.
	- The Product Owner discusses the objective that Sprint should achieve and the [[Product Backlog]] items that will help to achieve the Sprint goal.
## Sprint Lifecycle
### 1. [[Sprint Planning]]
- The team creates a plan for how they will build the backlog items and get them "Done" before the sprint ends.
	- The work items are chosen and the plan for how to get them done is part of the [[Sprint Backlog]]
### 2. [[Daily Scrum]]
- During the Sprint, the team checks in during a [[Daily Scrum]] (Standup) about how the work is progressing.
### 3. [[Sprint Review]]
- After a sprint the team demonstrates what they've completed during the review. 
### 4. [[Sprint Retrospective]]
