- A short time-boxed period is when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
- Many associate scrum sprints with agile, but they are not the same thing. **Scrum is a framework, agile is a set of principles**.
- Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of delivering working software frequently and responding to change quickly (over following a plan).
- Choosing the right work items for a sprint is a collaborative effort between the product owner, scrum master, and the development team.
	- The Product Owner discusses the objective that Sprint should achieve and the [[Product Backlog]] items that will help to achieve the sprint goal.
