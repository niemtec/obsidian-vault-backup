- Single ideas or captures of thought, can be read and understood without the need to refer to anything else.
- Each note should include **one idea and one idea only**. This makes it possible to link unique ideas.
- Each note should be autonomous (self-contained and comprehensible on its own). This allows notes to be rearranged independently.
