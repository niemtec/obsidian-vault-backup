- A form of respect for the dead or bereavement

- Ancient Egyptians buried people with riches that they might need in the next life
- Greeks were known to put a coin known as [[Charon's obol]] in the mouths of the deceased people
- In Jewish bereavement, there is archaeological evidence to suggest that Jewish people placed coins over the eyes of the dead
