A series of biochemical reactions are initiated in the [[Brain]] and other aerobic tissues after seconds/minutes of inadequate blood supply. Most ischemic neurons that die do so due to activation of chemicals produced during and after ischemia.

Ischemic cascade usually goes on for two to three hours but can last for days, even after normal blood flow returns.
