## Freud's view
For [[Sigmund Freud]], the body's most basic drive is sex or libido.

- Babies:
  - Libido centred around mouth and desire to suckle mother's breast
- Child - Adult:
  - Libido centres on reproductive organs and the desire to reproduce
  - Our first memory is our conception and being breastfed, but this is repressed.
  - This leads to hostile feelings towards the same-sex parent

## Jung's view
- Central to [[Carl Jung]]'s ideas is the concept of libido - the basic drive in all of us to be fulfilled in life. It is a "great river of energy" that is not exclusively sexual in origin.
- Religion plays an important part in becoming a healthy individual - the development of an individual's potential.
- Religion is a natural process stemming from the archetypes in the unconscious mind. Removing it could be detrimental as it harmonises the psyche.
