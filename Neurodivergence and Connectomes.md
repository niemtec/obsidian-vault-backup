- In a neurotypical brain, when the [[TPN]] is turned on and you’re on task, the [[DMN]] is turned off. 
- In the [[ADHD]] brain, the fMRI shows that when the [[TPN]] is turned on, the [[DMN]] is turned on as well, trying to muscle its way in and pull you into its grasp, thereby distracting you.
	- Therefore, the [[DMN]] competes with the [[TPN]], which in most people it does not do.
	- When trapped in the past or future in the [[DMN]], you’re likely to abandon projects you once started with enthusiasm, make careless mistakes, or, worse, fall into a state of misery and despair, for no good reason whatsoever.
