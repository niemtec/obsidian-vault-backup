- You are  alone in a room following a computer program for responding to Chinese characters slipped under the door. 
- You understand nothing of Chinese, and yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals just as a computer does, you send appropriate strings of Chinese characters back out under the door, and this leads those outside to mistakenly suppose there is a Chinese speaker in the room.Â 
- The narrow conclusion of the argument is that programming a digital computer may make it appear to understand language but could not produce real understanding.
