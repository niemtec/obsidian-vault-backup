**Draupnir** (Old Norse drɔupnez̠, "the dripper") is a gold ring possessed by the god Odin with the ability to multiply itself: Every ninth night, eight new rings 'drip' from Draupnir, each one of the same size and weight as the original.

It was forged by dwarves brothers Brokkr and Sindri as part of a set of three gifts which included [[Mjollnir]] and [[Gullinbursti]].

> Odin laid upon the pyre the gold ring called Draupnir; this quality attended it: that every ninth night there fell from it eight gold rings of equal weight. (from the *[Gylfaginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Gylfaginning "Gylfaginning")*).
