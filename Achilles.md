- Achilles was dipped in the waters of the river [[Styx]] by his mother during his childhood, acquiring invulnerability, with the exception of his heel, by which his mother held him.
- The only spot where Achilles was vulnerable was his heel, where he was struck and killed by Paris' arrow in the Trojan War. This is the source of the expression Achilles' heel, a metaphor for a vulnerable spot.
