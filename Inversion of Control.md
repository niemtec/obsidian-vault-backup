The **`Inversion-of-Control` (IoC)** pattern, is about providing *any kind* of `callback` (which controls reaction), instead of acting ourselves directly (in other words, inversion and/or redirecting control to an external handler/controller).

The **[[Dependency Injection]] (DI)** pattern is a more specific version of IoC pattern and is all about removing dependencies from your code.
