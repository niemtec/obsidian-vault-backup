- Your boss throws off a comment that you perceive as a slight. The rear part of the [[DMN]] spins into overdrive, looking back at what she said, taking it apart, wondering what you did to deserve that.
- Then there’s the front part of the [[DMN]], where you ruminate on plans and make lists. You go over and over and over what you will say to your boss to straighten things out, or how you will chastise her and quit, stressing about her reaction, your cowardice, and the fallout.

## Escaping
- Spend more time in the [[TPN]] focusing on a single task. You are already a master of distraction, so now distract yourself. Productivity isn’t the point here. Moving the toggle switch is.
- As a practical matter, this means that the minute you start to ruminate and slip into brooding negativity, look elsewhere. Do anything. Walk around. Yell. Or try an exercise that zeroes in on your breathing. 

> [!tldr] Breathing Pattern
> Pick a pattern to focus on, for example, 6-3-8-3. Inhale for six beats, hold for three, exhale for eight beats, hold for three; repeat. After a few cycles, you will move out of the [[DMN]].

- The point is to focus on anything external to yourself. Activating the [[TPN]] will shut down the [[DMN]]
	- It’s difficult to do because the [[DMN]] is seductive and the negative messages it is feeding you are captivating and convincing, borne out of your past experiences, but you must not allow yourself to be drawn in, you must quickly do something active, to engage the [[TPN]].
