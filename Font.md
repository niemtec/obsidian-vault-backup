A [[Typeface|typeface]] is a particular set of glyphs or sorts (an alphabet and its corresponding accessories such as numerals and punctuation) that share a common design. For example, Helvetica is a well known [[Typeface|typeface]]. A font is a particular set of glyphs within a [[Typeface|typeface]].

So, 12 point Helvetica is a font, and 10 point Helvetica is a separate font. The same goes for different weights â€“ a 14 point Helvetica Bold is a different font than a 14 pt Helvetica Light. They are different fonts, but the same [[Typeface|typeface]].
