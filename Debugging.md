- Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper, the inventor of COBOL, is credited with observing the first computer bug—literally, a moth caught in a relay in an early computer system. When asked to explain why the machine wasn’t behaving as intended, a technician reported that there was “a bug in the system,” and dutifully taped it—wings and all—into the log book.
- Debugging is a sensitive, emotional subject for many developers. Instead of attacking it as a puzzle to be solved, you may encounter denial, finger pointing, lame excuses, or just plain apathy.
- It doesn’t really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else’s. It is still your problem.

- When trying to solve any problem, you need to gather all the relevant data. You first need to be accurate in your observations.
- Once _you_ think you know what is going on, it's time to find out what the _program_ thinks is going on.
