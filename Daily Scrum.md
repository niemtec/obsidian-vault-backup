- A short daily meeting where the team check in on how the work is progressing. 
- The goal of this meeting is to surface any **blockers** and challenges that would impact the teams' ability to deliver the sprint goal.
- It follows a typical structure answering:
	- What did I work on yesterday?
	- What am I working on today?
	- What issue are blocking me?
