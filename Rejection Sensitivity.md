- A type of emotional dysregulation (a milder version of [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria]]) which can cause discomfort when experiencing (or perceiving) rejection.
- It can lead to severe anxiety from the anticipation of rejection, and trouble seeing non-positive interactions (such as neutral or vague reactions) as anything but rejection
- It can lead to overreaction leading to behaviour that reflects negative emotions like anger, range, extreme sadness, and severe anxiety
