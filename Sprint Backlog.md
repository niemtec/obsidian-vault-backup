- A prioritised list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements.
- The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first.
- The backlog serves as the connection between the product owner and the development team. They are free to re-prioritise work in the backlog at any time due to customer feedback, refining estimates, and new requirements.

> [!important]
> The team **doesn't** work through the backlog at the Product Owner's pace and the Product Owner **is not** pushing work to the development team. 
> The team pulls work from the backlog as there is capacity for it either continually ([[Kanban]]) or by iteration ([[Scrum]]).

- Once the backlog gets larger, product owners need to group the backlog into near-term and long-term items.
	- Near-term items need to be fully fleshed out before they are labelled as such. 
		- This means complete user stories have been drawn up, collaboration with design and development has been sorted out, and estimates from development have been made.
	- Longer-term items can remain a bit vague, though it's a good idea to get a rough estimate from the development team to help prioritise them.

> [!failure] Anti-Patterns to Watch For
> - The product owner prioritises the backlog at the start of the project (but does not adjust it as feedback rolls in from developers and stakeholders).
> - The team limits items on the backlog to those that are customer-facing.
