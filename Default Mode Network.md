- The DMN allows for expansive, imaginative, and creative thinking.
- The back half of the DMN — called the posterior cingulate — facilitates your autobiographic memory, and your personal history. 
	- This allows you to think back, draw upon, and pick apart the past.
- The front part, the medial prefrontal cortex, is the opposite. It enables you to look forward and to think about, imagine, and plan for the future.
