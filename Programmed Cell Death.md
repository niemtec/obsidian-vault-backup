- Known as cellular suicide
- The death of a cell as a result of the events **inside** the cell
- It usually confers an advantage during a lifecycle (for example the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose resulting in separate digits).

There are two main forms of cell death:

1. [[Apoptosis]] - Type I
2. [[Autophagy]] - Type II - characterised by the formation of large vacuoles that eat away organelles in a specific sequence prior to the destruction of the nucleus
