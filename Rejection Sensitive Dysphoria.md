---
- A condition where you experience intense emotional pain or discomfort because of a failure or feeling rejected
- These feelings are much stronger than the usual dislike of rejection
- People with RSD are more likely to interpret vague interactions as rejection and may find it difficult to control their reactions
- The condition seems to happen most often in people with [[ADHD]]

## Symptoms

- Easily embarrassed and self-conscious
- Signs of low self-esteem and trouble believing in themselves
- Difficulty containing emotions when feeling rejected (reacting with sudden shows of anger or rage or bursting into tears)
- Some people might turn their emotions inwardly which can look like a snap onset of severe depression (or sometimes mistakenly observed as sudden emotional shifts consistent with bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder)
- Often seen as "people pleasers" and can become intensely focused on avoiding the disapproval of others
- They avoid starting projects, tasks or goals where there's a chance of failure
- They compensate for their fear of failure or rejection by going all-out or striving for perfectionism (however they often experience intense anxiety and may not easily make self-care or downtime a priority)
