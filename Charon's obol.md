- An allusive term for the coin placed in or on the mouth of a dead person before burial
  - Green and Latin sources specify the coin as an obol and explain it as a payment or bribe for [[Charon]], the ferryman who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead
- In ancient times some believed that placing a coin (Charon's obol) in the mouth of the deceased would pay the toll for the ferry to cross the [[Acheron]] River, which would lead one to the entrance of the underworld. If someone could not pay the fee, they would never be able to cross the river.
