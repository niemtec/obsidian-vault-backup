> Scrum and [[Kanban]] share similar concepts but have very different approaches

|                     | **Scrum**                                                        | **Kanban**                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Cadence             | Regular fixed-length sprints                                     | Continuous flow            |
| Release Methodology | At the end of each sprint (if approved by PO)                    | Continually delivered      |
| Roles               | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team                    | No roles                   |
| Key Metrics         | Velocity                                                         | Cycle time                 |
| Change philosophy   | Teams should not make changes to sprint as it affects the estimation | Change can happen any time |

- Some teams blend the ideals of [[kanban]] and scrum into "scrumban".
	- They take fixed-length sprints and roles from scrum and focus on work-in-progress limits and cycle time from [[Kanban]].
