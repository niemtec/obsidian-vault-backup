Wakefulness and [[Sleep]] are under the control of the [[Circadian Rhythm]] and not the other way around.

Humans are not sleeping the way nature intended. The number of [[Sleep]] bouts, the duration of [[Sleep]], and when [[Sleep]] occurs have all been comprehensively distorted by modernity.

The practice of [[Biphasic Sleep]] is not cultural in origin. It is deeply biological. All humans, irrespective of culture or geographical location, have a genetically hardwired dip in alertness that occurs in the midafternoon hours. However, it is something that our modern world pushed out, instead promoting [[Mono-phasic Sleep]] [[Sleep]].

Five key factors have powerfully changed how much and how well we [[Sleep]]:

1. constant electric light as well as LED light
2. regularised temperature
3. [[Caffeine]]
4. alcohol
5. a legacy of punching time cards

## Temporal Distortion in [[Sleep]]

While the conscious mapping of [[Time]] is lost during [[Sleep]], at a non-conscious level, [[Time]] continues to be catalogued by the [[brain]]. Time dilation in [[dreams]] is common and it is often experienced as elongated, this dramatic deceleration of neural time makes [[dreams]] feel longer than they actually are.
