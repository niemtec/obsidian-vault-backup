In monophasic [[Sleep]], a person attains all of their [[Sleep]] in one block of time, typically at night.

Researchers hypothesise that mono-phasic [[Sleep]] became the dominant [[Sleep]] pattern during the industrial era when artificial lighting began enabling people to stay up past sunset. Prior to that, many people across different continents and cultures followed a [[Biphasic Sleep]] schedule.
