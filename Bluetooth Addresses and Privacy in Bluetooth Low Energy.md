- Privacy in terms of BLE devices focuses on ensuring that untrusted parties are not able to track a device by its Bluetooth address
- Privacy is achieved by using a resolvable private address

## Privacy Process for BLE

1. An [[IRK]] (Identity Resolving Key) is used in generating and resolving the [[Bluetooth Address#Resolvable Random Private Address|Resolvable Random Private Address]]
2. The [[IRK]] is generated by each device locally either randomly or assigned during manufacturing
3. During bonding each device stores its peer's [[IRK]] in what's called a revolving list
4. The [[IRK]] is used to resolve the private address of a peer device (when it receives the peer's advertising packets at a later time) which is done by verifying that the hash included in the private address matches the output of the local has

## Device Trust

- A trusted device can **bond** with another. Binding is an optional step that takes place after pairing two devices
  - The bonding process involves the storage of keys by each of the devices that are bonded with each other
  - Bonding allows two devices to pair seamlessly in connection subsequent to the original connection when the two devices were paired
  - One of the keys exchanged by the two bonded BLE devices is the [[IRK]] of each device involved
