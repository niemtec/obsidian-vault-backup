[[Carl Jung]] distinguished between the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious is shared by all humans and consists of a series of pre-dispositions known as archetypes.
People develop their own ideas of the archetype of God. Whether or not he actually exists, in reality, is beyond the scope of psychology.
We develop our own concept of God within our collective unconscious but our understanding of God will be different.
