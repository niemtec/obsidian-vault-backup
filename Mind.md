Mind is something very different from [[Soul]]. The mind isnâ€™t some mystical eternal entity. Nor is it an organ such as the eye or the [[brain]].

The mind is a flow of subjective experiences, such as [[Pain]], [[pleasure]], [[anger]] and [[love]]. Most up-to-date theories argue that sensations and [[emotions]] are fundamentally biochemical data-processing algorithms.
