- Having a routine doesn’t mean you sit in the same office every day for the same number of hours
- Your routine could be travelling to a different country every month — it could be being routinely un-routine
- It doesn’t matter what the routine consists of, but how steady and safe your subconscious mind is made through repetitive motions and expected outcomes
- Learning to craft a routine is like learning to let your conscious choices about what your day will be about guide you, letting all the other, temporary crap fall to the wayside

1. Your habits create your mood, and your mood is a filter through which you experience your life
2. You must learn to let your conscious decisions dictate your day — not your fears and impulses
3. **Happiness is not how many things you do, but how well you do them**
   - More is not better
   - Happiness is not experiencing something else; it’s continually experiencing what you already have in new and different ways
   - We are impaled with the fear that we are unhappy because we are not doing “enough”
4. When you regulate your daily actions, you deactivate your “fight or flight” instincts because you’re no longer confronting the unknown
   - This is why people who are constant with their habits experience so much joy: simply, their fear instincts are turned off long enough for them to actually enjoy something
5. As children, routine gives us a feeling of safety. As adults it gives us a feeling of purpose
   - When we are adults engaging with routine-ness, we can comfort ourselves with the simple idea of “I know how to do this, I’ve done it before”
6. When we don’t settle into a routine, we teach ourselves that “fear” is an indicator that we are doing the wrong thing, rather than just being very invested in the outcome
   - A lack of routine is just a breeding ground for perpetual procrastination
   - It gives us gaps and spaces in which our subs conscious minds can say “well, you can take a break now”
