- People often think [[Scrum]] and [[Agile]] are the same thing because [[Scrum]] is centred around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of [[Agile]]. However, [[Scrum]] is a framework for getting work done, whereas [[Agile]] is a philosophy.
- The agile philosophy centres around continuous incremental improvement through small and frequent releases.

> You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

- The scrum framework is heuristic; it’s based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors.
