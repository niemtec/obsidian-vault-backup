It is an encounter with the divine. It is a non-empirical occurrence that brings with it awareness of something beyond ourselves. A direct experience where the person having the experience feels that he or she is in contact with God.

[[Caroline Franks Davis]] defines seven types of religious experience:

1.  Seeing the work of God when looking at the world (awareness experience)
2.  Having a vision or inner experience of God (quasi-sensory experience)
3.  Encountering the holiness of God (numinous experience)
4.  Conversion experience (regenerative experience)
5.  Having prayers answered (interpretive experience)
6.  A sense of ultimate reality (mystical experience)
7.  Receiving enlightenment or knowledge (revelatory experience)

Many religious experiences happen in private thus there's no way of verifying them.

> "God was present, though invisible; he fell under not one of my sense, yet my consciousness perceived him"

> "The argument from personal experience is the one that is the most convincing to those who claim to have had one. But in the least convincing to anyone else" (Dawkins)

## Types of Religious Experience

### Dramatic or conversion event 

Considered a direct experience described as numinous, it refers to a religious experience which offers an insight into a "wholly other" nature of God.

### Responses to Life and the World 

Gentle, indirect experience which enhances a person's understanding of their life and the world around them.

> "Not just a feeling… but a conviction or insight, a sense that something must be" (Lewis)

### Revelatory experiences 

A divine self-disclosure, where God makes himself directly known via vision or dream. The experiment acquires new knowledge of God.

### Near-death experience 

Those include a feeling of peace and ineffability, going through a dark tunnel, meeting a being of light and having to make a decision about whether or not to cross a barrier before returning to life.

### Mystical experiences 

A mystical experience is one in which a person experiences the ultimate reality, which brings with it a sense of unity with the divine, separateness from the divine and dependence on the divine.

> "Human language is unable to express the sense of mystical union with God"

### Corporate experiences

A large number of people experience God at the same time. Such as the Toronto Blessing.
