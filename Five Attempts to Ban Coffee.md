## Mecca
[[Coffee]] was banned in Mecca in 1511 ( #C16 ) as it was believed to stimulate radical thinking and hanging out — the governor thought it might unite his opposition. It had a negative opinion because of its stimulatory properties — some Sufi sects would pass around a bowl of [[coffee]] at funerals to stay awake during prayers.

## Italy
Clergymen pressed for [[coffee]] to be banned when it arrived in Europe in the #C16. It was labelled Satanic, but received a papal blessing from Pope Clement VIII after he tasted the beverage.

## Constantinople
After Murad IV claimed the Ottoman throne in 1623, he quickly forbade [[coffee]] and set up a system of reasonable penalties. The punishment for a first offense was a beating. Anyone caught with [[coffee]] a second time was sewn into a leather bag and thrown into the waters of the Bosporus.

## Sweden
Sweden gave [[coffee]] the ax in 1746. The government also banned “[[coffee]] paraphernalia” — with cops confiscating cups and dishes. King Gustav III even ordered convicted murderers to drink [[coffee]] while doctors monitored how long the cups of joe took to kill them, which was great for convicts and boring for the doctors.

## Prussia
In 1777, Frederick the Great of Prussia issued a manifesto claiming beer’s superiority over [[coffee]]. He argued that [[coffee]] interfered with the country’s beer consumption, apparently hoping a royal statement would make Prussians eager for an eye-opening brew each morning. Frederick’s statement proclaimed, “His Majesty was brought up on beer,” explaining why he thought breakfast drinking was a good idea.
