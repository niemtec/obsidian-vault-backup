A Slovenian philosopher born in 1949 ( #timeline/CE20), suspicions of dissidence consigned him to academic backwaters. He came to western attention in 1989 with his first book written in English, [The Sublime Object of Ideology](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Sublime_Object_of_Ideology.html?id=EujcNVAlcw4C), a re-reading of Žižek's great hero [[Hegel]].

He challenges many of the founding assumptions of today’s left-liberal academy, including the elevation of difference or otherness to ends in themselves, the reading of the Western Enlightenment as implicitly totalitarian, and the pervasive skepticism towards any context-transcendent notions of truth or the good.

One feature of Žižek’s work is its singular philosophical and political reconsideration of [German [[Idealism]]](https://iep.utm.edu/germidea/) ([[Kant]], [[Schelling]]and [[Hegel]])
