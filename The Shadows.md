- Imagine that. you are one of the prisoners in [[the cave]]. You cannot look at anything behind or to the side of you — you must look at the wall in front of you.
- When people walk along the walkway, you can see shadows of the objects they are carrying cast on the wall.
- If you had never seen a real object ever before, you would believe that the shadows of the objects were "real"

> [!note]
> The Shadows represent the perceptions of those who believe empirical evidence ensures knowledge. If you believe that what you see should be taken as truth, then you are merely seeing a shadow of the truth. In [[Plato]]’s opinion, you are a ‘pleb’ if you believe this (their insult to those who are not Philosophers)!
