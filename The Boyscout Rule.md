Try and leave the world a little better than you’ve found it. If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot.

The clean-up doesn’t have to be something big:

- change one variable name for the better
- break up one function that is a little too large
- eliminate one small bit of duplication
- clean up one composite `if` statement
