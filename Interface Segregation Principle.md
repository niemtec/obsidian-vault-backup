- According to the principle, you should break down "fat" interfaces into more granular and specific ones.
- Clients should implement only the methods they really need
- Class inheritance lets a class have just one superclass, but it doesn't limit the number of interfaces that the class can implement at the same time.
  - There's no need to cram tons of unrelated methods into a single interface
  - Break it down into several more refined interfaces
