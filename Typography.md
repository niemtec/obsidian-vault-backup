Typography is a word which derived from the Greek words _typos_ meaning "form" or "impression" and _graphia_ meaning "writing", it originates from the first punches and dies used to make currency in ancient times which ties it to the history of [[printing]].

It is the art and technique of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader through the use of [[Font|font]] styles, appearance, and structure combinations which aim to elicit certain emotions and convey specific messages bringing text to life.

The arrangement of type involves selecting [[Typeface|typeface]]s, [[Point Sizes]], [[Line Lengths]], [[Leading]], [[Tracking]], and [[Kerning]]

## History

- The somewhat modern understanding of typography can be dated back to the 11th century ( #timeline/CE11 ) during the innovation of movable type, prior to the modern digital age, typography was a specialised craft associated with books and public works.
- The modern lead-based moveable type (along with the mechanical [[Printing Press]]) is attributed to Johannes Guttenberg ( #timeline/CE15 ) where his type pieces made from a lead-based alloy, suited printing purposes so well that the alloy is still used today.
  - Guttenberg developed specialised techniques for casting and combining cheap copies of letter punches in vast quantities required to print multiple copies of texts.
  - His breakthroughs were instrumental in starting the [[Printing Revolution]] and the first book printed with lead-based movable type was the [[Gutenberg Bible]].

## Distinction of Terms

- A [[Typeface|typeface]] is a particular set of glyphs or sorts (an alphabet and its corresponding accessories such as numerals and punctuation) that share a common design.
  - For example, Helvetica is a well known [[Typeface|typeface]]. A [[Font|font]] is a particular set of glyphs within a [[Typeface|typeface]]. So, 12 point Helvetica is a [[Font|font]], and 10 point Helvetica is a separate [[Font|font]].
  - The same goes for different weights – a 14 point Helvetica Bold is a different [[Font|font]] than a 14 pt Helvetica Light. They are different [[Font|font]]s, but the same [[Typeface|typeface]].
- The reason for this distinction isn't as important today as it was historically when a page of text was set by hand before printing, and meticulous organisation of thousands of small pieces of metal was essential. For centuries, a printer or typesetter would set type letter by letter from a type case.
- The type was stored in shallow wooden drawers, called job cases, that were divided into small compartments for each letter, numeral, ligature, punctuation mark, and varying widths of spacing.
- Older styles of type cases organised the capital letters in a separate case from the minuscules. The capital letter case was placed above the drawer of minuscules, which is where we get the terms “uppercase” and “lowercase.”

## Evolution

- The design of [[Typeface|typeface]]s has developed alongside the development of [typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting") systems. Although typography has evolved significantly from its origins, it is a largely conservative art that tends to cleave closely to tradition. This is because [legibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legibility "Legibility") is paramount, and so the [[Typeface|typeface]]s that are the most readable usually are retained.

## Modern Considerations

- Typography is much more than choosing beautiful [[Font|font]]s, over the years it has become a vital component of [[User Interface Design]]
  - Good typography establishes a strong [[Visual Hierarchy]], provides graphic balance, and sets the overall tone.
  - It can guide and inform users, optimise readability and accessibility, and ensure an excellent user experience.
