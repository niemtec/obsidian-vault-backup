-Ô∏è Organisation systems are a means of building out coping mechanisms.
	- They provide a sensation of control over the situation.
	- Research phases lead to more coping mechanisms (the cycle repeats)
- Forgetfulness is a very common element of ADHD.
- Masking: ADHD doesn't manifest clearly in a highly structured environment because of that structure.
	- Tools like Jira and methodologies like [[Scrum]] create a framework to help cope with the symptoms.
- Executive dysfunction can be adjusted using synthetic dopamine i.e. ADHD meds are great.
	- No withdrawal symptoms (apart from ADHD coming back)
	- Dose can be adjusted to suit each individual's needs
	- Meds can be started/stopped whenever
	- Treatment holidays are encouraged to avoid tolerance buildup.
	- Typically one-a-day, slow-release tablets.
- Medication might not provide a stark contrast after a while, it can be hard to notice the effects. At this point it's important to reflect on the progress made with and without medication.
- Overall Deadlines and checklists are great, as part of the need for structure.
- It's important to study your own triggers and habits and then improve them over time.
- Routines are great because, again, they provide structure.
- **Breaks are important.**
