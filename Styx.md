- The River of Hatred (also known as The Blue River), is both a Greek titan deity and an ancient blue river
- The river separates the Earth and the Underworld forming a boundary
- Deities were bound by the Styx and swore oaths upon Styx because during the [[Titan war]], the goddess of the river Styx sided with [[Zeus]], after the war Zeus promised every oath be sworn upon her
- According to some versions, Styx had miraculous powers and could make someone invulnerable
  - [[Achilles]] was dipped in the waters of the river by his mother during his childhood, acquiring invulnerability, with the exception of his heel, by which his mother held him
- The ferryman [[Charon]] often is described in contemporary literature as having transported the souls of the newly dead across this river into the underworld, although in the **original Greek and Roman sources**, as well as in [[Dante]], it was the river [[Acheron]] that [[Charon]] plied.
- [[Dante]] put [[Phlegyas]] as a ferryman over the Styx and made it the fifth circle of Hell, where the wrathful and sullen are punished by being drowned in the muddy waters for eternity, with the wrathful fighting each other.
