- A mental disorder which includes a combination of persistent problems such as difficulties paying attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour.
- This can lead to unstable relationships, poor school/work performance, low self-esteem, and other problems in adulthood. In some cases, it can go unnoticed until adulthood when the symptoms might not be as clear as in children.
- Adults often have **decreased** hyperactivity but still struggle with impulsiveness, and restlessness, and have difficulty with attention
  - Adult ADHD treatment includes medications, psychological counselling (psychotherapy) and treatment for any mental health conditions that occur along with ADHD.

## Symptoms

- The symptoms might range from mild to severe, many adults with ADHD are not aware they have it — they just know everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritise, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans.
- The inability to control impulses can range from impatience to mood swings and outbursts of anger
- Adult ADHD symptoms may include:
  - Impulsiveness
  - Disorganisation and problems prioritising
  - Poor time management skills
  - Problems focusing on a task
  - Trouble multitasking
  - Excessive activity or restlessness
  - Poor planning
  - Low frustration tolerance
  - Frequent mood swings
  - Problems following through and completing tasks
  - Hot temper
  - Trouble coping with stress

> Diagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety.

### Coexisting conditions

- Although ADHD doesn't cause other psychological or developmental problems, other disorders often occur along with ADHD and make treatment more challenging. These include:
  - **Mood disorders.** Many adults with ADHD also have [[depression]], [[bipolar disorder]] or another mood disorder. While mood problems aren't necessarily due directly to ADHD, **a repeated pattern of failures and frustrations due to ADHD can worsen depression**.
  - **Anxiety disorders.** [[Anxiety]] disorders occur fairly often in adults with ADHD. Anxiety disorders may cause overwhelming worry, nervousness and other symptoms. [[Anxiety]] can be made worse by the challenges and setbacks caused by ADHD.
  - **Other psychiatric disorders.** Adults with ADHD are at increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, such as personality disorders, intermittent explosive disorder and substance use disorders.
  - **Learning disabilities.** Adults with ADHD may score lower on academic testing than would be expected for their age, intelligence and education. Learning disabilities can include problems with understanding and communicating.
