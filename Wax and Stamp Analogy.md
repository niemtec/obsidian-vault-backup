- You can no more separate the body from the soul than you could separate the shape given to a lump of wax by a stamp from the wax itself. Where the shape is, there is the wax. Wax and stamp are different ideas but they cannot be separated.
- The soul is that which empowers the body to function as an active living thing.
  - In all the senses of cause, except material cause, the soul is the cause of the body.
  - The soul is at once the efficient cause (the body's source of origin of movement), the formal cause (the essence of the whole living body) and the final cause (the purpose for which the body exists).
  - If the body has potential for life, it is the soul that actualises that potentiality.
