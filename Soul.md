## Arguments against the existence of a Soul

> "If you really understand the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul." (Y. N. Harari)

- The theory of evolution cannot accept the idea of souls, at least if by ‘soul’ we mean something indivisible, immutable and potentially eternal. Such an entity cannot possibly result from a step-by-step evolution.
	- Evolution means change and is incapable of producing everlasting entities.
- Whereas the existence of eternal souls is pure conjecture, the experience of pain is a direct and very tangible reality. 
	- When I step on a nail, I can be 100 per cent certain that I feel pain (even if I so far lack a scientific explanation for it). 
	- In contrast, I cannot be certain that if the wound becomes infected and I die of gangrene, my soul will continue to exist.
