- Boredom is the kryptonite of the ADHD brain. The moment a person with ADHD experiences boredom — defined as a lack of stimulation — they reflexively, instantaneously, automatically, and without conscious thought seek stimulation.
- The type of stimulation is irrelevant, the drive to address the mental emergency — the brain pain — that boredom sets off is overwhelming.
