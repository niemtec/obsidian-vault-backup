- A behavioural pattern where a person spends an excessive amount of time daydreaming, often becoming immersed in their imagination ("maladaptive" means this type of daydreaming is an unhealthy or negative attempt to cope with or adapt to a problem)
- This is usually a coping mechanism in people who have mental health conditions like anxiety
- It can cause people to lose themselves in extremely vivid and detailed daydreams (this kind of daydreaming might be compulsive)

## Symptoms
- Engaging in extremely vivid, detailed, and elaborate periods of daydreaming which can last for a long time (people with this ability)
- Disconnection from what's happening around the person (similar to dissociation)
