Logic is considered to be a branch of [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] with some overlap between them considering that formal languages and deductive systems use mathematical objects, properties and relations. (Logic is also a central branch of [[computer science]], due, in part, to interesting computational relations in logical systems.)

Philosophically, logic is at least closely related to the study of correct reasoning. Reasoning is an [[epistemic]], mental activity. So logic is at least closely allied with epistemology.

Logic consists of a formal (or informal) [[Language]] together with a deductive system, the [[Language]] has components which correspond to a part of a natural [[Language]] like English.

The deductive system captures, codifies or simplifies record arguments that are valid for a given [[Language]]. The semantics is to capture, codify or record the meanings (or truth-conditions) for at least part of the [[Language]].
