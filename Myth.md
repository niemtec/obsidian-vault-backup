- Myth is the most complex type of symbolic language because it uses symbols, metaphors and imagery.
- A myth is a story or narrative that expresses a truth when it is not known for certain what actually happened
  > "Myth is a symbolic, approximate expression of truth which the human mind cannot perceive sharply and completely, but can only glimpse vaguely, and therefore cannot adequately or accurately express" (Burrows)
