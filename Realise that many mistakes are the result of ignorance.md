- When a person makes a decision that offends you, first consider whether they were “right to do this” in the sense that they were acting in a way that is morally acceptable (even if it is against your own self-interest)
- If someone is behaving in a reprehensible way, consider their actions to be based in ignorance (punishment for those should be done in an educational way)
