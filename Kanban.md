## History of Kanban
- Kanban methodology dates back to 1940s when Toyota began optimising its engineering processes based on the same model that supermarkets were using to stock their shelves.
	- Supermarkets stock just enough products to meet consumer demand to optimise the flow between the supermarket and the consumer.
		- Because inventory levels match consumption patterns, the supermarket gains significant efficiency in inventory management by decreasing the amount of excess stock it must hold at any given time.
- When Toyota applied this same system to its factory floors, the goal was to better align its massive inventory levels with the actual consumption of materials.
- To communicate capacity levels in real-time on the factory floor (and to suppliers), workers would pass a card, or "kanban", between teams.
- The signalling technology of this process has evolved since the 1940s, this same "just in time" (or JIT) manufacturing process is still at the heart of it.

## Kanban Boards
- All of kanban revolves around the Kanban Board â€” a tool used to visualise work and optimise the flow among the team.
- The board provides a clear visual overview of the current work within the team and clearly defines the workflow through a number of columns representing steps
	- Typically the processes contains three main steps: To Do, In Progress, and Done, but teams can add additional columns to better represent their processes.
- The kanban methodology relies upon full transparency of work and real-time communication of capacity. Therefore, the kanban board should be seen as the single source of truth for the team's work.

## Kanban Cards
- Kanban cards have become synonymous with "tickets" in the world of software development. 
- Their main purpose is to represent a unit of work as a card on the Kanban board and allow team members to track the progress of work through its workflow in a highly visual manner.
- The card contains all the critical feature information about a particular work item:
	- What needs doing
	- Who is
