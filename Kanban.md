> In Japanese, kanban literally translates to "visual signal"

- Kanban methodology dates back to 1940s when Toyota began optimising its engineering processes based on the same model that supermarkets were using to stock their shelves.
	- Supermarkets stock just enough products to meet consumer demand to optimise the flow between the supermarket and the consumer.
	- Because inventory levels match consumption patterns, the supermarket gains significant efficiency in inventory management by decreasing the amount of excess stock it must hold at any given time.
