- A symbol is something that identifies a concept that it is referring to and also participates in the meaning of that concept. Religious languages can be symbolic.
- Symbols go beyond that to express what the believer feels about what that symbol conveys. Symbols have a special significance in most religious traditions. Thus, the cross in Christianity identifies the religion and also participates in the important Christian concept of the death and [[resurrection]] of Jesus Christ, signifying salvation, sacrifice and hope.
- Symbolic language, including metaphors, similes, signs and myths, is always non-cognitive language.
- Symbols should not be interpreted literally because they are subtle modes of communication about that which is beyond the factual and objective. For this reason, symbols are important in religious language because they are non-cognitive and go beyond our normal understanding.
