- Typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design (pre-made blueprints that can be customised to solve recurring design problems in code)
- A high-level description of a solution and a general concept for solving a particular problem
- You can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you

## Anatomy of a pattern

- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution
- **Motivation** explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related
- **Code example** to make it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern

## Classification of patterns

- Most basic patterns are known as **idioms** and usually apply to a single programming language
- The most universal ones are called **architectural patterns** and are language-independent (can design the architecture of an entire application)
- They can also be categorised by their purpose:
  - **Creational patterns** provide object-creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
  - **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient
  - **Behavioural patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
