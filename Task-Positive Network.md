- The connectome that lights up when you’re engaged in a task is called the task-positive network, or TPN. Aptly named, the TPN gets you down to work.
- When in the task-positive network, you don’t consciously know whether you’re happy or not, which is just as good as being happy, if not better, because you’re not wasting any energy on self-assessment.
- When you’re thinking with the TPN, you’re in the Angel mindset.
- You can also get trapped in the TPN, doing a task from which you cannot disengage. This is the [[Hyperfocus|hyperfocussed]] state that people with ADHD can fall into.
- The reason that so many people are starting to look and act distracted as if they all have [[ADHD]] or [[VAST]], is that fewer and fewer people are spending time in the task-positive network.
- Unfortunately, the TPN is akin to a muscle that atrophies when not used. So as we mentally flit around, the TPN weakens and our attention span shortens.
- When you allow your mind to wander from a task, or when you finish the task, or if you pause too long in anger or dismay while doing the task, the TPN in your brain defaults to a different connectome.
