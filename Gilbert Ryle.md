- Gilbert Ryle in his book The Concept of Mind talks about "the ghost in the machine" where the mind/soul is like a ghost inhabiting the machine that is the body, he effectively **stigmatised** the mind into that form.
- Ryle was well known for his criticism of what he called the "official doctrine" of "Cartesian [[Dualism]]" as a theory of mind. (Descartes argued that the body is spatial and exists in space but is non-conscious while the mind is conscious but non-spatial)

> "The Newtonian system is no longer the sole paradigm of natural science. Man need not be degraded to a machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine. He might, after all, be a sort of animal, namely, a higher mammal. There has yet to be ventured the hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man." (Ryle)

- The Mind-Body problem is how a non-material mental substance can causally influence the material body. Ryle is somewhat influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who thought many philosophical problems were caused by misuse of language, Ryle said that the categorical mistake was applying properties to a non-material thing that is logically and grammatically appropriate.
