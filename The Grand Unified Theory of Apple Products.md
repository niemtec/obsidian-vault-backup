- Each product has a job: **make consumers feel like they don't need a larger, more powerful, device.**
  - **Apple Watch**: the job of the watch is to do more and more things on your wrist so that you don't need to pick up your iPhone
  - **iPhone**: the job of the iPhone is to do more things so that you don't need your iPad
  - **iPad**: it should be so powerful and capable that you never need a laptop
  - **MacBook**: it should make it so you never need a desktop
  - **iMac**: its job is to challenge what we think a computer can do and do things that no computer has ever done before
- This approach helps to describe the product really well and give it a distinct well-defined purpose in the users ecosystem.

## Apple Watch as a classic bet

- Apple Watch holds the most potential for making technology more personal.
- The overarching theme that transcends Apple products is the desire to make technology more personal, removing the barriers and allowing consumers to develop new and engaging relationships with technology.
- Some people mistakenly think that the Apple Watch is an inadequate iPhone replacement, but there is a subtle distinction: Apple Watch's role is to handle a growing number of tasks formerly given to the iPhone
  - For now the tasks might be simple notifications and checking time, but it's growing in the fields of health, identity and communication

## Don't expect iPad/Mac hybrid

- Apple will not follow Microsoft down the iPad/Mac hybrid path
- The Mac is the device that pushes everything forward by pushing the limits of personal computing
- An iPad/Mac hybrid would run against this trend as such a device is an explicit acknowledgement that the Mac is flawed as a product category
