- “How can brain processes cause consciousness?” — philosophers and even some scientists think that the relation cannot be causal because that would imply some version of [[Dualism]] of the brain and [[Consciousness]].
- The [[Chinese Room Argument]] has a simple structure:
	1. Programs are entirely statistical
	2. Minds have [[semantics]]
	3. Syntax is not the same as, nor by itself sufficient for, semantics
	4. Therefore programs are not minds (QED)
- The physics of implementing medium — that is, the actual physical-electrical-chemical properties of the computer in front of you — are irrelevant to computation.
- The third step of the [[Chinese Room Argument]] demonstrates that following a program does not imply understanding
	- Manipulating formal symbols is not in and of itself constitutive of having semantic contents, nor is it sufficient by itself to guarantee the presence of semantic contents.
	- You cannot milk semantics out of syntactical processes alone.
- The brain is a biological machine and it can think therefore at least some machines can think, furthermore human brains sometimes compute.
	- On one definition of a computer, brains are computers because they compute.
- You could discover computational processes in nature independently of human interpretation because any physical process you might find is computational only relative to some interpretation.
	- Computation is not a machine process like neuron firing or internal combustion, rather computation is an abstract mathematical process that exists only relative to conscious observers and interpreters.
- The brain is an organ like any other; it is an organic machine. Consciousness is caused by lower-level neuronal processes in the brain and is itself a feature of the brain.
	- Because it is a feature that emerges from certain neuronal activities, we can think of it as an “emergent property” of the brain.
		- An emergent property of a system is one that is causally explained by the behaviour of the elements of the system but it is not a property of any individual, elements and it cannot be explained as the summation of the properties of those elements.
