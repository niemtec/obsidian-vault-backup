## Emile Durkheim

> "The God and the society are one" ([[Emile Durkheim]])

- Durkheim saw religion as one of the forces that create within individuals a sense of moral obligation to adhere to society's demands.
- What exists is a unified social system which believes that it owes its being to God.
- Religion is not only a social creation, but is, in fact, society divinised - it is effectively made into the divine object of worship.
- Religion is essentially social, occurring in a social context, and when men celebrate sacred things, they unwittingly celebrate the power of the society to which they give sacred significance.
