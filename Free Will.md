## Arguments Against
- The belief in free will results from faulty [[Logic]]
- When a biochemical chain reaction makes me desire to press the right switch, I feel that I really want to press the right switch. This is true. I really do want to press it. Yet people erroneously jump to the conclusion that if I want to press it, I choose to want to. This is of course false. I don’t choose my desires. I only feel them, and act accordingly.
