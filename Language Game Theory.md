[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] advocated a functional theory of meaning, namely that words and language are part of an 'anti-realist' or postmodern approach to language. He argued that language statements are not intended to be true or false for everyone, but only for those who are within that form of life.

- The language in the game is [[Non-Cognitivism|Non-Cognitive]] - it is not about making universally true statements, but about communicating meaning to other players in the same way.
- Language can be correctly or incorrectly used within the rules of the game, but its primary purpose is not to make factual statements.
- As far as religious language is concerned, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was suggesting that it is meaningful when understood within the context of its own language game.
