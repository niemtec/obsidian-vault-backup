- Complexity is a silent killer of focus, clarity, and performance. It’s easy to let complexity slowly seep in — we tend to add, but rarely subtract.
- Examine the four environments of your life:
  1.  Physical Environment
  2.  Digital Environment
  3.  Mental Environment
  4.  Social Environment
- For each of the items ask two questions:
  1.  Is this necessary?
  2.  Is this energy creating?
- There are three potential outcomes:
  1.  “No” to both — remove
  2.  “Yes” to both — keep
  3.  “Yes” to one — think how necessary it is
- You are the product of your environment, so an environment comprised of necessary energy creators will compound positively. An environment cluttered with unnecessary energy drainers will compound negatively.

## Physical Environment

This includes things like clothes, material goods, and miscellaneous “stuff”. Consider each item, use the simplicity audit to reset, then use the 1-in-1-out rule to stay balanced.

## Digital Environment

Consists of things like technology, apps, and notifications. Fight back. Delete the apps, turn off the notifications, and batch process messages.

## Mental Environment

Centres around work, finances, household, and wellness. Every item in this environment requires energy to maintain. Automate or delegate when possible to reclaim headspace.

## Social Environment

Made up of things like family, friends, and coworkers. If any of them create energy, you should spend more time around them, however if any of them drain your energy then you should reduce their exposure to them.
