Based on the findings from other MRI studies that show that the central strip down the midline of the cerebellum—called the vermis—is ever so slightly smaller in people who have ADHD than in people who do not, it makes sense to think that stimulating and challenging the cerebellum/VCS, the way lifting a weight stimulates and challenges a muscle, might help reduce the negative symptoms of ADHD.
