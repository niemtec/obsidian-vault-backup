A model of [[Time Perception]] posing that a **memory trace** persists over time, by which one might judge the age of a [[memory]] and consecutively deduce how long ago the event occurred based on the strength of that trace.

(This conflicts with the observation that memories of recent events may fade more quickly than more distant ones)
